# Jinder 🔥  
**AI-Powered Job Matching Platform**

Jinder is an AI-driven job-matching application that intelligently connects candidates with relevant job opportunities based on skills, preferences, and experience. Inspired by modern recommendation systems, Jinder focuses on personalization, speed, and a clean user experience.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Finding the right job is noisy and inefficient. Jinder aims to reduce that friction by using AI-assisted matching logic to surface roles that actually fit a user, not just keyword matches.

This project explores how modern frontend frameworks, backend services, and AI-based decision-making logic can be combined to build a scalable, production-grade web application.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui

**Backend & Infrastructure**
- Supabase (Auth, Database, Storage)
- REST-style API interactions

**AI / Logic Layer**
- Rule-based + AI-assisted matching logic  
- Extensible architecture for future ML models

## 🧩 Architecture (High Level)

- **Frontend** handles UI, state management, and user interactions
- **Backend** manages authentication, data persistence, and access control
- **Matching Engine** evaluates user profiles against job data to generate recommendations

The system is designed to be modular, making it easy to improve the matching logic or replace it with more advanced ML models in the future.
